In this tutorial I will show how you can solve Odes, Pdes, (potentially hign dimensional) with neural networks. This post owes a lot to these papers [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07469), [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01806.pdf). 
My goal here is to give you the minimal code to solve your ode/pde (strangely enough, I didn't manage to find the easy to read tutorial post with code that we like so much) and some tricks I have encountered in my research.
