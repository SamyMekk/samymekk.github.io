We will show how neural networks can help to handle the main issues of the computations of XVAs.


This post will be related to the work I did during my internship as a Quantitative Research at Forvis Mazars during the period May-November 2024.

## A quick definition of XVAs <a name="whatIs"></a>



We will focus on computational aspects of $\text{XVAs}$. For a deep understanding of theses quantities, see [this book](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119508991).
<br>
$\text{XVAs}$ can be summarized as the following : 


- $\text{CVA}$ and $\text{DVA}$ represent 
- $\text{FVA}$ and $\text{MVA}$ represent
- $\text{KVA}$ represents

In the following, we will focus on the main quantity of interest for banks which is the $\text{CVA}$.
<br>
<br>
The $\text{CVA}$ equation is given by : 


$$
\begin{align}
CVA_t &= \mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}[(1-R^C) \mathbb{1}_{t \leq \tau^C \leq T} \frac{(V_{\tau^C})^+}{B_{\tau^C}}|\mathcal{G}_t]   \tag{1} \\
\end{align}
$$

$\text{with the following notations :}$

- $\mathbb{1}_{t \leq \tau^C \leq T}$ represents the potential default time between t and $T$.
- $R^C$ refers to the recovery rate
