In this blog post, we will focus on the some analysis on the space of probability measures as it is the main technical component arising in Mc-Kean Vlasov SDEs.

This blog post is mainly inspired from the excellent book of Carmona-Delarue : **Probabilistic Theory of Mean Field Games with Applications I** available [here](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-58920-6)
