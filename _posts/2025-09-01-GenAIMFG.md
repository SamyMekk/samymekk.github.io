In this blog post, we will try to give some basics concept on an emerging area in the Generative modelling community through the use of MFG-MFC theory. This blog post will be mostly inspired from the recent paper $\textbf{A mean-field games laboratory for generative modeling}$ available at this [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13534). We will also discuss other approaches
