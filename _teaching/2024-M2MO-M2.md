About some theoretical foundations in Machine Learning for Finance 

## About organisation

I will be giving 2 lectures at ENSAE Paris for the course of [Machine Learning For Finance](https://www.ensae.fr/courses/82) starting at the second semester of the academic year 2024-2025.  

## Planning


- Session of **March 5, 2025**: This session is about Gaussian Process Regressions ($\textit{GPR}$) and their use in finance and insurance. Slides I used during the presentation will be available soon and the associated notebook is available [here](\notebooks\GPR in Finance.ipynb)
- Session of **March 19, 2025**: This session will be about Deep Learning to solve Partial Differential Equations ($\textit{PDE}$s) arising in Finance. Slides will be available soon as the associated notebook.
