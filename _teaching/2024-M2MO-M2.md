About some theoretical foundations in Machine Learning for Finance 

## About organisation

I gave 2 lectures at ENSAE Paris for the course of [Machine Learning For Finance](https://www.ensae.fr/courses/82) starting at the second semester of the academic year 2024-2025.  

## Planning


- Session of **March 5, 2025**: This session will be about Gaussian Process Regression ($\mathcal{GPR}$) and their use in finance and insurance. Slides I used during the presentation are available [here](https://samymekk.github.io/files/M2MO-Course/GPR-Presentation.pdf) and the associated notebook is available by clicking [here](\teaching\notebooks\GPR in Finance - 5 March 2025.ipynb). Note that I will update soon a PDF file with all the basics to be known in $\mathcal{GPR}$.
  

- Session of **March 19, 2025**: This session will be about Deep Learning to solve Partial Differential Equations ($\mathcal{PDEs})$ arising in finance. Slides are available [here](https://samymekk.github.io/files/M2MO-Course/Deep Learning for PDEs- Lab Session-August 2025.pdf) here and the associated notebook is available by clicking [here](\teaching\notebooks\DL for PDE - 19 March 2025.ipynb). Note that I will update soon a PDF file with all the basics to be known in Deep Learning for PDE and MDP from the recent litterature.
