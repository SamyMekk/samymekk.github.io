A course about numerical algorithms to solve stochastic control problems taught at the Master El Karoui.

## Global organisation

I teach the lab sessions of the course **Stochastic Control and Machine Learning** taught at M2PF (Master El Karoui). The course is structured around 3 parts :

- Deep Learning for PDE solvers.
- Reinforcement learning for stochastic control problems
- Generative AI for data generation.
