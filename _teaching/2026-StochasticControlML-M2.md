A course about numerical algorithms to solve stochastic control problems.

## Global organisation

I teach the lab sessions of the course **Stochastic Control and Machine Learning** taught at M2PF (Master El Karoui). The course is structured around 3 parts :

- Deep Learning for PDE solvers.
- Reinforcement learning for stochastic control problems.
- Generative AI for data generation.
  
The content of the course is presented in the following [page](https://samymekk.github.io/Labs-Stochastic-Control-and-Machine-Learning/).
