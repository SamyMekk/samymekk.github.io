I was a PhD student at [LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris/) (Laboratoire de Probabilités, Statistique et Modélisation), at Université Paris-Diderot in Paris, France, from 2018 to 2021. My advisors were [Huyên Pham](https://sites.google.com/site/phamxuanhuyen/) and [René Aïd](https://sites.google.com/view/reneaid). I am now quantitative researcher at [QRT](https://www.qube-rt.com/).

Research interests
======
During my PhD, my research interest lies at the boundary between stochastic control, infinite dimensional structures and non-markovian settings (delay, Volterra, fractional noise,...). My work focuses on exhibiting the nice structures behind some classes of non-markovian problems and designing efficient algorithms to solve them. On a more applied side, I developed neural network based algorithms for stochastic control of high dimensional objects for a company named [Qovoltis](https://www.qovoltis.com/). 

Other activities
======
I had the opportunity to help [Qovoltis](https://www.qovoltis.com/) build smart charging stations for electric vehicules. I suggest you check their website, it's a really cool growing company with a strong determination to be on the technological forefront !
