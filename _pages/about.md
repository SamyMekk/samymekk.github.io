I am a PhD student at [LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris/) (Laboratoire de Probabilités, Statistique et Modélisation), at Université Paris-Diderot in Paris, France, since September 2018. My advisor is [Huyên Pham](https://sites.google.com/site/phamxuanhuyen/).

Research interests
======
My research interest lies at the boundary between stochastic control, infinite dimensional structures and non-markovian settings (delay, fractional noise,...). My work focuses on exhibiting the nice structures behind some classes of non-markovian problems and designing efficient algorithms to solve them.

Upcoming events:
======
_January 29-31 2020_: I will present our paper Linear–Quadratic optimal control for a class of stochastic Volterra equations: solvability and approximation at [QFW2020](http://qfw2020.uniparthenope.it/) in Naples, Italy.
