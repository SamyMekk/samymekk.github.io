I am a PhD student at [LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris/) (Laboratoire de Probabilités, Statistique et Modélisation), at Université Paris-Diderot in Paris, France, since September 2018. My advisors are [Huyên Pham](https://sites.google.com/site/phamxuanhuyen/) and [René Aïd](https://sites.google.com/view/reneaid).

Research interests
======
My research interest lies at the boundary between stochastic control, infinite dimensional structures and non-markovian settings (delay, Volterra, fractional noise,...). My work focuses on exhibiting the nice structures behind some classes of non-markovian problems and designing efficient algorithms to solve them. The infinite dimensional structures I am tackling (Hilbert or even Banach spaces) lead me naturally towards the use of deep learning.
