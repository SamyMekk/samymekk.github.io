I am  a PhD student at [CMAP](https://cmap.ip-paris.fr/)  (Centre de Mathématiques Appliquées de l'Ecole Polytechnique), at Ecole Polytechnique, France. My advisors are [Huyên Pham](https://sites.google.com/site/phamxuanhuyen/) and [Idris Kharroubi](https://finance.math.upmc.fr/authors/idris-kharroubi/) .
<br> 
Before my PhD, I graduated from both [Master M2MO](https://masterfinance.math.univ-paris-diderot.fr/) (Modélisation Aléatoire) and [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/). 
<br>
From the end of 2024, I may be a member of the [French Actuariat Institute](https://www.
institutdesactuaires.com/).  You can find my actuarial dissertation [here](https://samymekk.github.io/files/Mémoire_d_Actuariat-Samy.pdf) which focusses on the numerical methods (from classic numerical methods to supervised learning algorithms) for pricing and hedging of XVAs.


Research interests
======

During my PhD, i will be working on the modeling and control of complex systems with heterogeneous interactions. It is related to the mean-field game theory developped by Lasry and Lions and my work will be to focus on the extention on the heteregoneous interaction between the agents.
