## Abstract

We consider a class of stochastic control problems with a delayed control, both in
drift and diffusion, of the type \\[dXt = α_{t−d}(bdt + σdWt).\\] We provide a new characterization of the solution in terms of a set of Riccati partial differential equations.
Existence and uniqueness are obtained under a sufficient condition expressed directly
as a relation between the horizon T$$ and the quantity d(b/σ)^2. Furthermore, a deep learning scheme is designed and used to illustrate the effect of delay on the Markowitz
portfolio allocation problem with execution delay.
