## Abstract

We establish existence and uniqueness for infinite dimensional Riccati equations
taking values in the Banach space L<sub>1</sub>(µ ⊗ µ) for certain signed matrix measures µ
which are not necessarily finite. Such equations can be seen as the infinite dimensional
analogue of matrix Riccati equations and they appear in the Linear–Quadratic control
theory of stochastic Volterra equations.
